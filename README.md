Everything is ready for implementing into real project.
All is need is to include library into project and then import buttons from lib directory and use them.(or publish on NPM and use it as a module)

```sh
import Button from 'Attendify_test_assignment_ChernoK/lib/buttons';
...
...
...
<Button.B1Brand buttonSize="large">

</Button.B1Brand>

```
